    <h1>Testing Edge Inspect</h1>
    <p>We're having trouble getting Edge Inspect (and Weinre) to work with our web apps. The web apps run fine if neither Edge Inspect nor Weinre are loaded. These are a couple of tests of theories to help pinpoint the issues.</p>

    <p>Possibly related bugs and discussions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-604">doesn't work in strict mode</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/weinre/UHvupao7B0Y">Error using Weinre with Require.js</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>"strict mode" and XHR don't play along well</h2>
    <p>The minimal test <a href="strict-with-hbs.html">strict-with-hbs</a> says this is running fine</p>
